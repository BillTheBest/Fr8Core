## Making Your Terminal Visible on the Public Web

To work with Hub at [dev.fr8.co](http://dev.fr8.co) and [fr8.co](http://fr8.co) you must provide publically accessible HTTP endpoint. Ideally, DNS address of this endpoint should not change through the time, otherwise you'll have to register your terminal everytime endpoint is changed. Fr8 doesn't restrict terminal endpoint to be HTTPS.

So here is few options to go with:

* Hosting providers
* Dynamic DNS services
* ngrok
* Fr8 doesn't restrict terminal endpoints to have DNS name. So just publically accessible static IP will work too.
