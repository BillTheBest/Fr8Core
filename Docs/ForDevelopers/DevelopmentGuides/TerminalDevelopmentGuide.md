Terminals are discrete Web Services that host Activity functionality.
The main Fr8 Hub runs many of these Terminals itself, but the architecture is decoupled: as far as the Hub is concerned, each Terminal is on the other end of an HTTP request. A fully operational Hub may work with hundreds of different Terminals.
The initial Terminals being built and hosted by The fr8 Company are .Net based Azure Web App Projects
