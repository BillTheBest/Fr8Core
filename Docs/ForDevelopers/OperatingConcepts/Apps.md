Fr8 Apps

Fr8 Apps are essentially Fr8 Plans that have been packaged for use outside of the Fr8 environment. They allow the Plan Builder to create
an application, wrap it in a simple, functional UI, and distribute it via an URL to any number of users. Those users don't see the Plan Builder environment. Instead,
they see a mobile-optimized, forms-based UI:

Clicking Submit in an App triggers the underlying Plan. 

To create an App, start with a normal Plan and then insert an App Builder Activity at the beginning:





Right now, the user has to have a Fr8 Account to use an App. That may change.
