Notification Services
=====================

[Go to Contents]( /Docs/Home.md)

Notifications are messages intended to be seen by end users, (as distinct from [Events](/Docs/ForDevelopers/OperatingConcepts/Events.md)). They can be divided into two categories: Activity Stream messages and Toast notifications.


## Activity Stream

The primary mechanism for delivering Notifications to users is the Activity Stream, which is based on [Pusher](https://pusher.com/). Messages are displayed in the right-side of the screen. They can be generated by the Hub on behalf of the Terminal, often as a result of an [Activity Response](/Docs/ForDevelopers/Objects/Activities/ActivityResponses.md), or through direct Terminal requests to the Hub.

There are currently 5 type of Notification messages:

•	Generic Success

•	Generic Failure

•	Generic Info

•	Terminal Event (Used for displaying specific messages generated by terminals during the execution)

•	Execution Stopped

These notification types can report an error of validation, successful execution, or information on terminals/activity states.


Generating a Notification Message
---------------------------------

Notification messages coming from Terminal requests are classified under "Terminal Event" type and displayed with bolt icon on the screen. They can be generated with this call: 


*Url*

	{{Fr8HubCallBackUrl}}/api/{{Fr8HubApiVersion}}/notifications

*Method*

    POST

*Request Body*
```javascript
{
	"ActivityName" : "App_Builder",
	"ActivityVersion": "1",
	"Collapsed": false,
	"Message": "This is a plan message/description",
	"Subject": "This is a custom (optional) header for message",
	"TerminalName": "terminalFr8Core",
	"TerminalVersion" : "1"
}
```


## Toast Notifications

They uses same mechanism as in Activity Stream and render incoming pusher messages as Toast messages, based on whether there is a Activity Stream panel on screen. With this automatic rendering, developers are not supposed to have to worry about front end layout issues. Example usage of these messages can be found in [App Builder Activity](Docs/ForDevelopers/OperatingConcepts/Apps.md) which is optimized visually for mobile screen sizes. Absence of Activity Stream causes display of alert message at the top-center of page (implemented with [Noty library](http://ned.im/noty/)) in Kiosk Mode.
