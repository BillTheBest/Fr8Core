Notification Services
=====================

[Go to Contents]( /Docs/Home.md)

Notifications are messages intended to be seen by end users, as distinct from [Events](/Docs/ForDevelopers/OperatingConcepts/Events.md). They can be divided to two categories as Activity Stream messages and toast notifications.


## Activity Stream

The primary mechanism for delivering Notifications to users is Activity Stream, which is implemented based on [Pusher](https://pusher.com/). It provide us server-to-client messaging channel per user session and later these messages are displayed in the right-side panel named “Activity Stream”. They can be generated by Hub on behalf of Terminal as a result of [Activity Response](), or by terminal requests to the Hub.

At the moment, there are 5 type of Notification messages at the Activity Stream:

•	Generic Success

•	Generic Failure

•	Generic Info

•	Terminal Event (Used for displaying specific messages generated by terminals during the execution)

•	Execution Stopped

These notification types can report an error of validation, successful execution, or information on terminals/activity states. Although most of the notifications are pre-defined messages sent by Hub (based on Activity Responses), Terminals can also inform users with their “Terminal Event” notifications:


*Url*

	{{Fr8HubCallBackUrl}}/api/{{Fr8HubApiVersion}}/notifications

*Method*

    POST

*Request Body*
```javascript
{
	"ActivityName" : "App_Builder",
	"ActivityVersion": "1",
	"Collapsed": false,
	"Message": "This is a plan message/description",
	"NotificationArea": 1,	// ActvityStream = 1, Toast = 2
	"Subject": "This is a custom (optional) header for message",
	"TerminalName": "terminalFr8Core",
	"TerminalVersion" : "1"
}
```


## Toast Messages

They have similar mechanism as Activity Stream and also uses Pusher service for sending messages from server to client. Toast messages can be seen in 4 types as: *Success, Error, Info and Alert* (which are implemented with [Noty library](http://ned.im/noty/). Example request for Toast messages can be found down below:

*Url*

	{{Fr8HubCallBackUrl}}/api/{{Fr8HubApiVersion}}/notifications

*Method*

    POST

*Request Body*
```javascript
{
	"ActivityName" : "App_Builder",
	"ActivityVersion": "1",
	"Message": "This is a toast message",
	"NotificationArea": 2,	// ActivityStream = 1, Toast = 2
	"NotificationType": 1,	// Success = 1, Error = 2, Info = 3, Alert = 4
	"TerminalName": "terminalFr8Core",
	"TerminalVersion" : "1"
}
```

It is recommended to use Activity Stream as notifications but there can be some special cases arises for using toast messages like in App Builder activity. App Builder Apps are optimized visually for mobile screen sizes, so they don't use a visible Activity Stream. Instead of activity stream, displaying toast messages in Kiosk mode is our best use-case.
