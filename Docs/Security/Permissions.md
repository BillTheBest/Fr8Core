Permissions are generally associated with Users via Profiles. The Standard Fr8 User Profile, for example, causes a user to receive Edit Object
permission on all objects they create.

Fr8 currently supports these permissions:
1. Create Object
2. Read Object
3. Edit Object
4. Delete Object
5. Run Object
6. View All Objects
7.  Modify All Objects
8. Manage Fr8 Users
9. Manage Internal Users

## Permission Sets

Permission Sets make it easier to work with sets of permissions. They are a representation of specific group of permissions, grouped by the type of the object that those permissions need to authorize.   
Permission Sets cannot currently be directly manipulated. They are used internally to  form Profiles.
