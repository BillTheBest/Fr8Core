    <h1>Upstream Crates</h1>
    <p>Upstream Crates contain the data from the Actions that are "upstream", or to the left, of an Action. For example, if Action 1 knows how to load a spreadsheet from Google Sheets and extract the data, and Action 2 knows how to send emails, you might want to have Action 2 send an email to an email address extracted from the spreadsheet. To do that you'd have Action 2 look upstream to see what email addresses had been extracted by Action 1.</p>
